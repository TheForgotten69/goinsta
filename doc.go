/*
	Package goinsta implements Goinsta private API in Golang.
	We changed the API for the comfort of the user.
	The new API is object-oriented making the programming bot task less repetitive.

	Currently the API is very complete (we did it in a week xd).
	If you see that Goinsta needs any method or any new feature you are free to open
	an issue in github.com/ahmdrz/goinsta we will work to solve your issue as soon
	as possible. Also you can make your own contributions.
	See https://github.com/ahmdrz/goinsta/blob/master/CONTRIBUTION.md
